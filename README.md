# WoW Raid Log Analysis Parser

A sophisticated Python-based log analysis tool designed to process and analyze World of Warcraft raid logs from the [Log Analysis App](https://discord.gg/BsDUfgKddA) Discord bot. This project demonstrates advanced data processing, pattern recognition, and statistical analysis capabilities, transforming raw raid logs into actionable insights for raid teams.

## üéØ Project Overview

This tool was developed to enhance the capabilities of the Log Analysis App Discord bot, which provides real-time raid log analysis for World of Warcraft raid teams. The parser supports multiple boss encounters and:

- Transforms Discord-formatted logs into structured data
- Provides deeper analysis than the bot's basic output
- Tracks specific mechanics and player performance
- Generates comprehensive statistics for performance analysis
- Helps raid teams make data-driven decisions to improve performance

## üîå Integration

### Log Analysis App Integration
- Processes logs directly from the [Log Analysis App](https://discord.gg/BsDUfgKddA) Discord bot
- Compatible with the bot's standard output format
- Enhances the bot's basic analysis with additional insights
- Designed for easy extension to future boss encounters

### Current Scope
- **Supported Bosses**: 
  - **Mug'Zee**: Goblin-themed encounter with cluster bombs and rockets
  - **Stix Bunkjunker**: Mechanical boss with scrapmaster mechanics and bombshells
  - **Gallywix**: Complex encounter with canisters, enrage mechanics, and multiple phases
- **Mechanics Tracked**: 
  - Boss-specific mechanics for each encounter
  - Player deaths and mistake analysis
  - Raid-wide mechanic failures
  - Performance timing and duration tracking
- **Analysis Depth**: Detailed tracking of both raid-wide and individual player performance

### Extensibility
The modular design allows for easy adaptation to:
- Future boss encounters in the current tier
- New mechanics and abilities in upcoming tiers
- Additional analysis metrics and statistics
- Integration with other analysis tools

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.x**: Leveraged for robust data processing and analysis
- **Regular Expressions**: Advanced pattern matching for log parsing
- **Data Structures**: Efficient use of defaultdict for data aggregation
- **CSV Processing**: Structured data export for easy analysis
- **Character Encoding**: Sophisticated handling of Unicode characters
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular boss class system for easy extension

### Key Technical Features
- **Pattern Recognition**: Complex regex patterns to identify and categorize raid events
- **Data Normalization**: Intelligent handling of special characters and inconsistent formatting
- **Statistical Analysis**: Automated generation of detailed performance metrics
- **Data Verification**: Built-in validation system ensuring parsing accuracy
- **Modular Design**: Clean, maintainable code structure with separate concerns
- **Boss-Specific Parsing**: Custom logic for each boss encounter's unique mechanics

## üìä Features

### Data Processing
- Intelligent parsing of raid logs with timestamp tracking
- Automated extraction of player deaths and raid mechanics
- Special character normalization for consistent data handling
- Duration calculation and attempt sequencing
- Boss-specific event detection and parsing

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Raid Mistakes Tally**: Tracks non-player mistakes (e.g., unsoaked mechanics)
- **Player Mistake Tally**: Individual player performance metrics
- **Mechanic Mistake Tally**: Detailed analysis of specific mechanic failures
- **Time-based Analysis**: Duration tracking for performance optimization
- **Boss-Specific Analysis**: Custom metrics for each boss encounter

### Output Generation
- **CSV Export**: Structured data for spreadsheet analysis
- **Text Reports**: Human-readable detailed statistics
- **Verification Logs**: Data integrity validation reports

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Standard library modules (no external dependencies)
- Access to Log Analysis App Discord bot output

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy your Log Analysis App Discord bot output into `data.txt`
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python clean_data.py
   ```
4. Access the generated reports:
   - `cleaned_data.csv` for spreadsheet analysis
   - `cleaned_data.txt` for detailed statistics
   - `verification_results.txt` for data validation

### Input Format Example
The script processes logs in the Log Analysis App format:
```
Mug'Zee #1   (4:33)
:warning: Experimental :warning:
:MugZee_mine: Player died to popping a mine (1:23.4)
:MugZee_spear: Player died to Frostshatter Spear (2:45.6)
5/24/2025 6:40 PM
```
